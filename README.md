Josad's Journey is a game that teaches students in highschool to graph functions. 

The player will be given a graph in which they will need to independently formulate a function to pass their curve through the 'start point', and pass through the 'safezone', or 'greenzone'. Optional goals offer bonus points such as crossing 'coins' scattered across the graph. Penalties will be given if the player crosses the 'redzone' in which points will be deducted. Once the level is complete, the scoreboard will calculate the player's overall score which depends on: no. of tries taken, safezone crossed, coins collected, penalties. They will also be given an overall grade such as 'A+' dependant on their score.


There are 2 gamemodes to Josad's Journey: Journey, and Zen:

Journey consists of 18 levels increasing in difficulty.  Every level is carefully made so the 'solution function' covers as many graph concepts as possible, involving functions ranging from radicals to trigonometry. Initially, all levels are locked but the first. The player needs to complete all the easier levels before proceeding to the difficult ones, ie. completing a level will unlock the proceeding 2 levels. 

Zen is a casual gamemode where everything from coins to graph dimensions are all randomly generated. Here the player can play around, test different functions and see what constants there are, such as 'pi' used in sinusoidal functions, and 'e' used in exponentials. This gamemode counts player's cumulative score over all levels they've completed along with the round.


There are tools to help players if they are stuck graphing functions. click the '(x,y)' icon to reveal item coordinates, and the '(?)' icon to reveal a hint. Toggling this once reveals the first stage hint which displays the graph type e.g., 'quadratic'. Toggling this again reveals the second stage hint which gives the form of the solution curve e.g., f(x) = a(x+b)+c.

Note that there is no 'hint' in Zen, as everything is RNG, there is no 'solution curve' for these rounds.




The folder "Draft 1", done during the 2 week holidays between terms 1 and 2, * is eating into time in term 2, mainly focuses on developing purely the functionality behind my game by making it work as intended, using tkinter and matplotlib. 

The folder "Draft 2", done during term 2 after holidays, will focus on developing the graphics and visually appealing user interface behind my game, maybe sticking with tkinter and matplotlib but maybe also incoporating pygame as tkinter becomes very ploddy and slow when running continuous systems, which impacts the aesthetics.


My program includes 2 original sound tracks both composed by me, 'josad ost.mp3' and 'zen ost.mp3'.

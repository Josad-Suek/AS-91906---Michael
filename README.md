The game is based around teaching the user how to formulate and graph mathematical functions in a fun way. The player will be given a randomly generated graph in which they will need to independently formulate a function to achieve goals such as making their curve start from a 'start point' and reach a 'end point'. Bonus points will be rewarded if the player's curve manages to cross through 'tokens', or 'coins' randomly scattered across the graph. The player will be penalised if their curve crosses through a 'red zone'. etc. Once their function has been graphed, the game will calculate and sum up all the points the player has achieved as well as taking time taken into account. The player who scores the highest points will win the round. 

The folder "Draft 1", done during the 2 week holidays between terms 1 and 2, mainly focuses on developing purely the functionality behind my game by making it work as intended, using tkinter and matplotlib. 

The folder "Draft 2", done during term 2 after holidays, will focus on developing the graphics and visually appealing user interface behind my game, maybe sticking with tkinter and matplotlib but maybe also incoporating pygame as tkinter becomes very ploddy and slow when running continuous systems, which impacts the aesthetics.

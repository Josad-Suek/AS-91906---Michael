Class: Seed generates a graph at a random location on the x/y-plane, of random size. 
Begins by generating the upper and lower domains (x axis length) ranging from -200 to 200.
Then generates the upper and lower ranges (y axis length) initially equal to its domain, this is so the graph is to scale.
var.offset generates a random value from 0 to the midpoint of the y axis length.
This value is used to offset the new upper and lower ranges by a difference of var.offset, producing a randomly generated seed.
